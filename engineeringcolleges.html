<h2>Campus Overview</h2>
<p>IIT Chennai is situated on Sardar Patel Road and is flanked by Adyar, Taramani and Velachery. The campus is opposite the Central Leather Research Institute and Anna University. It is spread over 250 hectares of lush green forest, which is midway between the Chennai Airport and Central Railway station, and is well connected by buses and local trains</p>
<p>The Institute in itself is located around 2.5 km inside the campus. Two parallel roads, Bonn Avenue and Delhi avenue, lead you through the residential zone, under a canopy of green, to Gajendra Circle (otherwise called GC) and the administrative block. Buses ply between the gate and other locations on the campus at regular intervals. Named after mountains, the IITM buses take you to the GC, academic zone and hostels (named after rivers) for a nominal fare. This has in fact led to the joke that IIT is the land of moving mountains and stationary rivers!</p>
